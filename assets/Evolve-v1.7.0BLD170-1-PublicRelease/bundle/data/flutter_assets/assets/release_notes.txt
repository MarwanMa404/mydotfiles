[v1.5.5]
-Notable Bug Fixes:
    (*) Adaptive Colours: The app's color now consistently updates after generating a theme. Further refinement is still required.
    (*) Online Wallpapers: When applied, they now automatically generate the corresponding GTK theme based on the wallpaper, provided that "Adaptive Colours" is enabled.
    (*) User Themes Shell Extension: The expired link to the screenshot has been updated, resolving the issue of a fallback image being displayed.
    (*) Search and Text Boxes: A visual issue introduced with the new search feature has been resolved, restoring the correct appearance of search and text boxes.
    (*) Online Wallpaper Preview: The transition from a blurry image to the original high-quality wallpaper is now smooth, fixing the previous glitchy behavior.
    (*) Config Applicator: Previously, the applicator would exit if an extension required for the configuration was unavailable (commonly on Ubuntu). It now displays a message in the terminal instead of exiting abruptly due to an exception.
    (*) Window Buttons Layout: The incorrect arrangement of window buttons when not all were enabled has been fixed.

-New Features:
    (*) Shell Theme Setup: A new "Shell Theme" option has been added to the first launch page. This feature checks if the User Themes extension is installed and allows users to install it directly from the app if not present.
    (*) Command Update: The deprecated "convert" command used for Adaptive Colours has been replaced with the "magick" command. However, "convert" will still be used as a fallback if "magick" is not available.
